    <h1>11. Resident Evil 4

The Resident Evil series has transitioned perspectives and genres a lot, but no single entry was as revolutionary of a jump as Resident Evil 4. Evolving the Resident Evil games from locked camera angle survival horror games with tank controls to a third-person survival horror action game was nothing short of brilliant. Resident Evil 4 was and still is an absolutely incredible, near-perfect video game. The campaign is massive and packed with gigantic bosses, epic setpieces, and locales, matched only by the precision-perfect gameplay that gives the player a ton of weapons and actions to utilize against hordes of horrible enemies.

There was really nothing like it at the time and it not only changed the course of survival horror games forever, it also inspired the third-person action game genre - and eventually, Resident Evil Village. Modern players approaching it for the first time today might be slightly put off by its lack of run-and-gun gameplay, but if they can adapt to the stop-and-shoot (and kick, grenade, knife, and suplex) style of action, theyâ€™ll be rewarded with one of the greatest single player campaigns to ever grace a video game. -- Brian Altano</h1>
